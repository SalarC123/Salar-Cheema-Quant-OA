# Carousel

**Difficulty: 3**

Thank you for applying to Quant! We are interested in your application and want to see what you can do with the skills and knowledge you possess. Please read through the following prompt for directions.

## **Prompt: Photo Carousel**

Your task is to build a single webpage with a photo carousel and navbar in React JS similar to the one seen [here](https://samuelbradley.com/portfolio/portfolio/). Specifically, your implementation should abide by the following rules:

- Your carousel may not have visible navigation buttons. Users should be able to scroll through the pictures by clicking anywhere in the left or right quarters of the screen (if the screen was divided into 4 columns, these would be the first and fourth columns respectively).
- Images should cross-fade into each other when the user scrolls to the next image.
- Your webpage should have a dummy navbar. The menu buttons should be responsive to hovers (with a red underline), but they don't need to lead anywhere (i.e clicking on them does nothing).
- The navbar and header should have the same background, similar to the example provided above.

All other design choices are left up to you. You are free to use any libaries within React you wish to. For demonstration purposes, 5 pictures are enough on the carousel. You do not need to optimize for multiple screens. Either mobile or desktop view is fine.

You will be graded on how responsive your UI is, how closely it matches the specs, the readability of your code, and the ease with which other programmers can expand on your carousel. This means it would also be wise to include some information on how to run your code, what your code does, and maybe even a section stating what future improvements would be in case someone else hops on your project.

The assessment specs are intentionally minimal. If you have any questions, please reach out to Neel Khare on Discord or email neel.khare@quantillinois.com. Good luck!
